## Release Information
eRepublik Advanced 4.2.6dev

### Google Chrome
After completing these steps you should have a working extension.

1.  Copy the `chrome` folder to somewhere on your computer.
2.  Put the `data` folder and the contents of the `src` and `vendor` folders into it.
3.  Open `chrome://extensions` and make sure `Developer mode` is on.
4.  Click `Load unpacked extension...` and give it the `chrome` folder you built.

Every time you make changes in the extension's folder you have to reload the extension. There is a reload link below the extension.

### Important
Unless you know how to make a Firefox extension, you won't be able to run and test the script on Firefox at the moment. There will be tutorials and examples how to make everything work. In the meantime you can get familiar with the script.

The source is a big mess right now, but it will get better with time. I have plans and solutions that I will share later on.
